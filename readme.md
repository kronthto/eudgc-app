Scanning, verifying and extracting/decoding of Covid19 Digital Health Certificates (Digitaler Impfnachweis / EU Digital Green Certificate) is entirely possible only using JavaScript in the Browser sandbox, without need for a native app and the privacy concerns that come with installing that.
This is a hobby project.
Do not rely on this as an alternative to official CovPass/Check apps.
